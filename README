ANSWER REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION
#About Melfort chat service:
1. The chat service will prune messages sent before November 30th 2020. This is because most of the chat before that
date is testing message. The chat after Nov 30th really boils up so that why I implement it this way, and to keep all
the good memories here, I will keep all the messages sent after 30th.
2. I implement the select command, with the PS3 prompting for a username, ALL, or STOP. This will avoid reading into
every people's messages, which really accelerate the speed of the service. Of course, when people want to, they can read
all.
